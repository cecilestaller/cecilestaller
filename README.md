### Hi there üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüåÖ

I'm Cecile a certified Fullstack Developer and during the last 6,5 months I have been taking part in a Fullstack Web Developer Bootcamp at SuperCode and able to gain extensive knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js by planning and implementing projects every day, either in a team or on my own.

I completed the frontend part of the bootcamp, which included topics such as JavaScript, React.js, Git, REST API and SCRUM, with an e-shop project at the end of December. We then moved on to the backend, focusing on Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB, which was incredibly fun and enabled me to implement full-stack projects. Two weeks ago, I reached the first milestone of my journey, as we presented the result of our two-week final project, an event platform (EventPilot), in front of a large audience and received our certificates.

Now I would like to further expand my skills in web development and realize interesting projects with like-minded people. üëØ
True to the motto: "Eat, Code, Sleep, Repeat"
