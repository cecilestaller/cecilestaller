### Hi there 🧘‍♀️🏄‍♀️🌅

I'm Cecile and I'm currently taking part in a Fullstack Web Developer Bootcamp at SuperCode. During the last four months I have been able to gain extensive knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript by planning and implementing projects every day, either in a team or on my own. When we started working with the React framework, the websites became more dynamic and responsive. 

I have already successfully completed the frontend part of the bootcamp, I am looking forward to the next three months where we will get into the backend and thus also into node.js, express.js and MongoDB. 

After the bootcamp, I would like to further expand my skills in web development and realize interesting projects with like-minded people. 👯
True to the motto: "Eat, Code, Sleep, Repeat"
